    </head>
    <body>
        <script>
            var name = "raha";// this function scoped (it is variable declaration statement)
            let age= 60;// this is block scoped
            const PI= 3.14;// it's better use const as default and if there is a need of changing the in future we can use let preferably
            console.log(name);( it is a function call statement)
        </script>
        
    </body>
