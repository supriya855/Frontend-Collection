statement is anything you can do in js  is a statement  like modifiying a varible and declaring it
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>BegineerJS</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script>
            var name = "raha";// this function scoped (it is variable declaration statement)
            let age= 60;// this is block scoped
            const PI= 3.14;// it's better use const as default and if there is a need of changing the in future we can use let preferably
            console.log(name);( it is a function call statement)
            var dog; //undefined 
            
        </script>
        
    </body>
</html>
var name='raha';
let age=400;
const cool=true;

Difference between these three
1. var and let can be updated
name='john';
age=300;
cool=false;// it gives an error (Assignment to const variable)

2. var is function scoped and let is block scoped

3. const by default  
4. let when needed

///Naming Convention
const Dog = 'bowser';
const $$$$$$ =100;// t works
//$ and _ are supported

// Let's get into naming Convention
//camelCase
const iLovePizza// except for the first one every word has CapitalCase
//UpperCamel Case
const ILoveToEatHotDogs ="false";
//snake_case
const this_is_snake_case='cool';
//kebab case
const this-is-kebab-case=false;// it is not supported in js
